# Incremental Heuristic Search in AI

## Structure

The files of importance are ```D_star.py``` and ```LPAstar.py```, implementing the D* algorithm and LPA* algorithm respectively. When running either of them, it will open a realtime matplotlib where the user can add obstacles. Adding an obstacle will trigger the algorithm to recalculate the optimal path.

## Executing

It is recommended to use a python version >= 3.0.
The project dependencies are listed inside the requirements.txt file.

### Running the D* Algorithm

```python3 D_star.py```

### Running the LPA* Algorithm

```python3 LPAstar.py```

## References

 - The following GitHub [repository](https://github.com/zhm-real/PathPlanning) was leveraged for the code implementation.
